## What is Horizon?

Horizon is a chrome extension designed to combat mindless "doomscrolling" on infinite-feed websites. Instead of being a harsh site blocker, Horizon introduces a unique, physics-based resistance to your scroll.

The longer you scroll down a targeted page (like social media or a news site), the more a simulated **gravitational pull** increases, making it physically harder to continue. This gentle, tangible feedback breaks the hypnotic trance of the scroll, making you conscious of your time and helping you to disengage mindfully.

## The Philosophy: Mindful Resistance

### The Problem with 'Hard Blocking'
Traditional site blockers are binary—they're either ON or OFF. This can be frustrating when you need temporary access, often leading users to disable them and forget to turn them back on. This all-or-nothing approach doesn't build better habits; it just erects a temporary wall.

### The Horizon Approach
Horizon is different. It's built on the principle of **interoceptive awareness**—linking a digital habit to a physical sensation.

By adding a real, physical cost to the normally effortless act of scrolling, Horizon creates a feedback loop that forces you to ask: **"Is this content worth the effort?"** It transforms a passive, unconscious habit into an active, conscious choice, empowering you to reclaim your focus without frustration.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Gravity Well:** Real-time scroll resistance that increases the deeper you go into a feed.
*   **Customizable Physics Engine:** Fine-tune the **Time Dilation** (how fast gravity increases), **Event Horizon Limit** (maximum resistance), and **Hawking Radiation** (scroll-up recovery rate) to match your personal tolerance.
*   **Target Acquisition System:** You are in full control. Easily add any website to the physics engine with a single click.
*   **Time Dilation Log:** The popup shows you exactly how much time you've spent on each target site, providing clear insight into your browsing habits.
*   **Instantaneous Control:** A master switch toggles the entire system on or off instantly, with no page reloads required.
*   **100% Private & Offline:** All your settings and time-tracking data are stored locally on your machine. Nothing is ever sent to a server. Your browsing history is yours alone.

## Installation

### Option 1: Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to install Horizon directly from the official store.

[**Install from the Chrome Web Store**](<!-- Add your Chrome Web Store link here -->)

### Option 2: From Source (For Developers)

If you want to tinker with the code, you can install the extension locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/horizon.git
    ```
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
4.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5.  Select the cloned `horizon` directory.

## How to Use

Welcome, Operator. Engaging the Horizon system is simple.

1.  **Designate Your Targets:**
    -   Navigate to a website you want to manage (e.g., twitter.com).
    -   Click the Horizon icon in your toolbar to open the popup.
    -   Go to the **"Target Sites"** tab and click the **"+ Add Current Tab"** button. The site is now under Horizon's influence.

2.  **Feel the Gravity:**
    -   Start scrolling down the targeted page. You will notice a subtle drag that grows progressively stronger.

3.  **Calibrate the Physics (Optional):**
    -   Open the **"Physics"** tab to adjust the engine's parameters to your liking. The changes will apply instantly.

4.  **Stay in Command:**
    -   Use the master toggle in the popup's header to enable or disable the entire system at any time.

## Technology Stack

*   **Manifest V3:** The latest Chrome Extension platform specification.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** No frameworks, just Vanilla JS for maximum performance and minimal overhead.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the popup's structure and the "Deep Space Glassmorphism" UI.
